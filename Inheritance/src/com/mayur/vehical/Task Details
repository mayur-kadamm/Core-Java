Task 1: Vehicle Hierarchy (Basic Inheritance)

🎯 Goal:
Understand single and multilevel inheritance + method overriding.

💡 Description:
            Create a base class Vehicle and subclasses:
                                Car,Bike,ElectricCar (extends Car)


 Each class should have:
 Common method: startEngine()
 Subclass-specific method: e.g., chargeBattery() for ElectricCar.


Override startEngine() in each class and print different messages.
🧮 Example:
Vehicle v = new ElectricCar();
v.startEngine(); // Output: "Electric car starting silently..."

✅ Learned Concept: Basic inheritance, overriding, runtime polymorphism.
